# PE Demo Configuration
# ---------------------
#
# This PE-CFN config retrieves modules from the Puppet Forge that populate Puppet
# agents with some basic content for use in demonstrating Puppet Enterprise Console.
#
# This stack deploys the user variance module to all machines
# and installs a vanilla wordpress installation on one agent.
# You can access the web interface on port 80 after the stack is built.
#
# A common use of this config is to demonstrate and tinker with Puppet
# Enterprise 2.0. Once created, one can browse to port 443 on the masters
# ec2 public hostname and login with user: 'cfn_user' and password: 'cfn_password'.
#
# I encourage you to take a look at the Enterprise Console, experiment with Live
# Management, see how that relates to MCollective and otherwise enjoy a fully
# functional Puppet environment.
#
#
# This section specifies which modules to grab from forge.puppetlabs.com

  - rcoleman-pe_demo
# dashboard_groups allow you to specify multiple classes and parameters and then
# simply include the group on your agents instead of repeating the classification
# over and over.

# Here's where the Puppet agents are defined. Note that the Puppet Master is
# automatically defined for you.

  # This agent will receive a fully functional wordpress website with demo content.
  # visit its public dns name via port 80 in your browser once it's built.
  Agent1:
    classes:
      - pe_demo::motd::noop
