This project contains an aws cloud formation template that is capable of deploying
a cluster of nodes with puppet enterprise installed.

## Installation

The amazon cloud formation client tools can be downloaded
using the cloudformation puppet class.

The following example manifest can be found at examples/install.pp

  class { 'cloudformation':
    aws_access_key => '< your key here >',
    aws_secret_key => '< your secret key here >'
  }

Add your aws credentials to the class declaration, ensure the cloudformation module
is in your module path, and use puppet to apply the installation manifest:

  puppet apply examples/install.pp

This will install the client tools and create the file: bashrc_cfn

Configure your cfn client tools by sourcing this file:

  source bash_rc

After you source this file, verify that your cfn tools work:

  cfn-describe-stacks

## Cloud formation face

After you have sourced the bashrc file, you should be able to use the cloudformation face.

To get details of how to use the face, you can run:

  puppet help cloudformation deploy

The cloudformation face allows you to specify data in yaml that can be used to
deploy a full application stack using Puppet Enterprise.

It creates all of the required AWS resources, including: security groups, IAM users, an
ec2 instance with the puppet master and modules installed, and a configurable number of
puppet agents with their classification information specified.

## stack config file

The config file used to specify how to build the stack takes the following configuration
options:

install_modules - list of modules that should be installed on the master from the moduleforge

  install_modules
   - puppetlabs-stdlib
   - puppetlabs-ntp

The above example, would create the directories ntp and stdlib at the /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules
directory.

puppet_agents - hash of ec2 instances that should be created and have puppet agents installed on
them.

The structure of the hash is described below:

puppet_agents:
  resource_id:
    class_name1:
      class_param1
    class_name2:
      class_param2

There are a few existing examples in teh config directory:

# deploying a stack

The following invocation will deploy one of the example stacks:

  puppet cloudformation deploy --keyname dans_keys --config config/ntp_nodes.config --stack-name DanStack1 --disable-rollback
